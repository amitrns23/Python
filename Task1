#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

first_number = int(input("Enter first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter second number: "))

Addition = first_number + second_number
Subtraction = first_number - second_number
Multiplication = first_number * second_number
Division = first_number / second_number

print("Addition: ", Addition)
print("Subtraction: ", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", Multiplication)
print("Division: ", Division)
